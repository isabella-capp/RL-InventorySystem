# RL-InventorySystem

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (I use this for fast dependency management)

### Installation

Clone and set up the environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MarinCervinschi/rl-inventorysystem.git
cd rl-inventorysystem
uv sync
```

That's it! `uv sync` creates a virtual environment and installs everything you need.
